# Details
<b>Implement your own Dictionary (with many more features than the traditional one!)</b>

The main feature is obviously to search for a meaning of a particular word and their type noun/verb etc. In many of the dictionaries when we enter a wrong word it shows “no results found”, but you will implement a function that displays words similar to the entered word available in the dictionary if they are not found. This can be implemented in various ways but you shall use Prefix matching.

Implementation:

● A search history. It helps the user to memorize the words as sometimes it happens that you forgot the words you searched for before, but you want to search the meaning again because you forgot it;

● A translator from English to French.

Note that,

● you will need to use the provided CSV with 5,588 English words, their type (noun, preposition, verb, etc.), meaning, and French translation;

● you should create a simple menu in consol for each of the above-mentioned features i.e. for 1) search word 2) print history 3) translate the word (the way you made it in TP1)
